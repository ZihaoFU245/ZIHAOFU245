## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an math, engineering and computer science student with a passion for problem-solving and building cool, efficient software.  
Currently studying mathematics at HKUST, with a strong interest in AI, data science, and system design.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - A Jarvis-like assistant called "Itâ€™s Friday!" (Python FastAPI + React + Electron)
  - Machine learning & LLM infrastructure (DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenAI Agent SDK, MCP integration)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - PyTorch and reinforcement learning
  - Advanced Java & Python (data structures, graph algorithms, backend dev)
  - Game development with Unity (C#)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - AI agents & open-source LLM projects
  - Educational tech or math visualization tools
  - Efficient backend systems
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
  - Real-world applications of reinforcement learning (For Starters)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - Python, Java, C++, algorithms, AI/ML, Unity, or anything math-related
  - How to connect LLMs to real-world agent systems (MCP, API design)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:  
  - **zihaofu12@gmail.com**
  - **zfuat@connect.ust.hk**  
  Or just DM me on GitHub!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact:  
  - Iâ€™ve studied abroad in Madrid, Berkeley  
  - Iâ€™m always optimizing workflows, whether itâ€™s code, learning, or gaming  
  - Chess, Minecraft, and hacking new tech stacks are my favorite ways to unwind
